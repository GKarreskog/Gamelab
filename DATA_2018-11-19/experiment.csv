Welcome! 
In this HIT you will use this web page to play a number of games.
To play, click the <i class=""fa fa-navicon""></i> menu icon in the upper left-hand corner then click <q>Play</q>.
</p>
<h3>HIT overview</h3>
<p>
You will participate in @@gamelab-rounds@@ rounds.  
In each round you and others will make decisions in @@gamelab-games@@ games.  
These games are identical in all rounds.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the completion fee you will earn a bonus payment that
depends on both your own and others' decisions in the games.
</p>
<p>
Each round will last for @@gamelab-round-time-minutes@@ minute.
</p>
<h3>Game setup</h3>
<p>
Each game is given in a table and you will have to choose 1 or more
rows to play in each. 
You will then be matched against one of the other participants who will
choose one or more columns.
</p>
Your payoff for a given row and column combination is the first number
in each cell, shown in:
<i class=""gamelab-colour fa fa-square""></i>.
The column player's payoff is the second number in each cell, shown in:
<i class=""gamelab-ocolour fa fa-square""></i>.
Your payoff contributes to your bonus payment, with higher payoffs
resulting in a higher bonus payment.
</p>
<p>
You will only get payoffs from the rows you choose to play. 
However, column players will be choosing which of the columns to play,
so you won't have full control over the payoff you get.
</p>
<p>
After you have chosen which rows to play you must assign a weight to
each of these. 
The weights must add up to <strong>1</strong>. 
A weight of <strong>1</strong> means that payoffs (for you and the
column player) will be calculated solely based on that row. 
A smaller weight, for example <strong>1/2</strong>, means that <strong>1/2</strong> of your payoffs will
be calculated from that row. 
The columns from which your payoffs are calculated are chosen by the
column players in the same fashion.
</p>
<p>
To make a decision in a game, first click all rows you want to play and
then input the weights you want to assign to them. 
Once you have chosen rows and weights, click the <q>Submit play</q> button
and then the <q>Go to next game</q> button to proceed to the next game.
</p>
<p>
You must make decisions for all @@gamelab-games@@ games in a round in
order to receive payoffs from that round.
</p>
<h3>Bonus payments</h3>
<p>
Your payoffs from a game depend on the rows and weights you choose, as
well as  how the column players choose on average. 
Other players' payoffs are calculated in the same fashion.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the task your total payoffs will be calculated by summing
your payoffs from all games in all rounds in which you have
participated. 
Your payoff will be converted to USD at a 1 payoff
point = @@gamelab-conversion@@ rate.
</p>
<h3>History of play</h3>
<p>
The graphs on the play page and on the <q>History</q> tab provide
information about the games and how they have been played in previous
rounds. 
This information includes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	Your previous payoffs.
	</li>
	<li> 
	How much payoff you would have gotten by choosing each row with full weight (1) in previous
	rounds.
	</li>
	<li>The average choices of the row and column players in previous rounds.</li>
</ul>
